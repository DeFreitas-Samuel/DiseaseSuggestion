# DiseaseSuggestion

DiseaseSuggestion is an app that will show the user what possible diseases and conditions they could have based on group of symptoms that the user provided; also the app will provide a set of recommended test so the user nows what are the next steps in treating their symptoms.

This app was developed using XamarinForms and it uses the EndlessMedical API to perform its predictions.
